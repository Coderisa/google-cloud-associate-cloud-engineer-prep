# Notes

![https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781119816324/files/images/c01uf000.png](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781119816324/files/images/c01uf000.png)

## 5 characteristics that define cloud computing

1. **On-demand self-service:** Cloud users can provision computing resources, such as compute, storage, and networking, on demand. This means that users can scale up or down their resources as needed, without having to worry about provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure.
2. **Broad network access:** Cloud resources are accessible over the internet, which means that users can access them from anywhere. This makes cloud computing ideal for businesses that have a global workforce or that need to be able to access their data from anywhere.
3. **Resource pooling:** Cloud providers pool their resources and share them among multiple users. This allows cloud providers to achieve economies of scale and offer their services at a lower cost than traditional on-premises IT.
4. **Rapid elasticity:** Cloud resources can be scaled up or down rapidly, in response to changes in demand. This allows businesses to save money by only provisioning the resources they need, when they need them.
5. **Measured service:** Cloud providers charge their users based on the amount of resources they consume. This allows businesses to track their costs and optimize their usage.

These are just some of the characteristics that define cloud computing. Cloud computing is a rapidly evolving field, and new characteristics are being developed all the time.

## Cloud Deployment Model

A cloud deployment model is a way of organizing and delivering cloud computing services. There are three main cloud deployment models:

- **Public cloud:** Public clouds are owned and operated by a cloud service provider (CSP). Users access public clouds over the internet. Public clouds are the most popular cloud deployment model.
- **Private cloud:** Private clouds are owned and operated by an organization. Users access private clouds over a private network. Private clouds are often used by organizations that need to comply with specific security or regulatory requirements.
- **Hybrid cloud:** Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds. Users can access resources from both public and private clouds. Hybrid clouds are often used by organizations that want to take advantage of the benefits of both public and private clouds.

Here is a table that summarizes the different cloud deployment models:

| Cloud Deployment Model | Ownership | Access | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public cloud | CSP | Internet | Scalability, cost-effectiveness, ease of use | Security, compliance, control |
| Private cloud | Organization | Private network | Security, compliance, control | Cost, complexity |
| Hybrid cloud | Organization, CSP | Both public and private networks | Best of both worlds | Complexity, cost |

The best cloud deployment model for an organization will depend on its specific needs and requirements.

Here are some of the factors that organizations should consider when choosing a cloud deployment model:

- **Security:** The security of the cloud deployment model is a critical factor. Organizations need to make sure that their data is secure in the cloud.
- **Compliance:** Organizations that need to comply with specific security or regulatory requirements may need to use a private cloud.
- **Cost:** The cost of the cloud deployment model is also a factor. Public clouds are typically more cost-effective than private clouds.
- **Scalability:** The scalability of the cloud deployment model is important for organizations that need to be able to scale their cloud resources up or down as needed.
- **Control:** The level of control that an organization has over the cloud deployment model is also a factor. Private clouds offer more control than public clouds.

## Cloud Service Model Consepts

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS is like ordering a frozen pizza. The pizza company provides all of the ingredients, but you have to do the cooking yourself. This means that you have to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure, such as compute, storage, and networking.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS is like ordering a pizza from a restaurant. The restaurant provides the dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings, but you don't have to do any cooking. This means that you don't have to worry about provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure. Instead, you can focus on developing and deploying your applications.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS is like ordering a pizza from a delivery service. The delivery service provides the pizza, and you don't have to do anything. This means that you don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or developing anything. You can simply use the service as-is.

Here is a table that summarizes the different cloud service models and their pizza analogies:

| Cloud Service Model | Pizza Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Frozen pizza |
| Platform as a Service (PaaS) | Restaurant-made pizza |
| Software as a Service (SaaS) | Delivery-service pizza |

## Google Cloud Fundamentals

### Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

- Google Cloud has a global infrastructure of data centers and regions.
- There are currently 24 regions and 73 zones in Google Cloud.
- Each region is a geographic area with multiple zones.
- Zones are isolated from each other, so if one zone goes down, the others will still be up.
- Google Cloud uses a variety of technologies to ensure the reliability and performance of its global infrastructure.
- These technologies include:
    - Load balancing
    - Redundant storage
    - High-speed networking
    - Disaster recovery

Here are some additional details about Google Cloud Global Infrastructure:

- The regions are spread across the globe, so you can choose the region that is best for your application.
- The zones are located within each region, and they are designed to be as close to each other as possible.
- This helps to ensure that your application will have low latency, even if it is accessed from anywhere in the world.
- Google Cloud Global Infrastructure is designed to be highly reliable.
- If one zone goes down, your application will continue to run in the other zones.
- This helps to ensure that your application is always available.

### Networking Services

### Networks, Firewalls and Routes

![Untitled](Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20-%20Associate%20Exam%20Prep%20f562c31336a343c1a19bef917fea9ad8/Untitled%203.png)

the instructor discusses the different networking services that are available on Google Cloud. He starts by talking about VPC networks, which are isolated virtual networks that you can create in Google Cloud. He then discusses subnets, which are subnetworks within a VPC network. Subnets allow you to further divide your network and control access to specific resources.

The instructor then talks about firewall rules, which control the traffic that is allowed to flow in and out of your VPC networks and subnets. He also discusses load balancing, which distributes traffic across multiple instances of your applications. This can help to improve performance and availability.

Finally, the instructor talks about VPN tunnels and Cloud Interconnect. VPN tunnels allow you to connect your Google Cloud resources to your on-premises network. Cloud Interconnect provides a high-speed, dedicated connection between your Google Cloud resources and your on-premises network.

Here are some additional points to note from this section:

- Google Cloud offers a wide range of networking services, so you can choose the ones that are right for your needs.
- The Networking Services section of the course covers the basics of networking in Google Cloud, so you will be well-prepared to create and manage your own networks.
- The course also includes hands-on exercises, so you can practice what you have learned.

I hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Here are some specific points that the instructor made in this section:

- VPC networks are a great way to isolate your resources and control your network traffic.
- Subnets allow you to further divide your network and control access to specific resources.
- Firewall rules are essential for controlling the traffic that is allowed to flow in and out of your networks.
- Load balancing can help to improve the performance and availability of your applications.
- VPN tunnels and Cloud Interconnect allow you to connect your Google Cloud resources to your on-premises network.

## Resource Hierarchy

![Untitled](Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20-%20Associate%20Exam%20Prep%20f562c31336a343c1a19bef917fea9ad8/Untitled%204.png)

- **Resources** are the basic building blocks of Google Cloud. They can be anything from virtual machines to databases to storage buckets.
- **Projects** are a way to organize your resources. You can create multiple projects and assign different resources to each project.
- **Organizations** are a way to group projects together. This can be useful for managing large numbers of projects or for enforcing security policies across multiple projects.
- **Folders** are a way to organize projects and organizations. You can create folders to group related projects and organizations together.

The resource hierarchy in Google Cloud is as follows:

- **Resource**
    - **Project**
        - **Folder**
            - **Organization**

The instructor in the video also mentions that you can use the **Cloud Console** to view the resource hierarchy for your account.

Here are some additional points to note about resource hierarchy:

- The resource hierarchy is a way to organize your resources for better management and control.
- You can use the resource hierarchy to enforce security policies across your projects and organizations.
- The resource hierarchy is a hierarchical structure, meaning that each resource can only be a child of one parent resource

![Untitled](Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20-%20Associate%20Exam%20Prep%20f562c31336a343c1a19bef917fea9ad8/Untitled%205.png)

1. **Organization**: Represents the entire company or domain, in this case, "bowtieinc.co". All resources and entities within Google Cloud belong to and are organized under an organization. Policies set at the organization level are inherited by every resource beneath it.
2. **Folders**: You can think of folders as containers or categories to further segment and organize projects or other resources. They can represent departments, teams, or any other divisional structure. In our example, Tony Bowtie is a member of "Department B", which is represented by a folder.
3. **Projects**: Within GCP, projects are core organizational units, and they contain all the service-level resources. In our example, "Department B" has two projects: Project X and Project Y.
4. **Resource**: This represents any service-level entity created within Google Cloud, such as VM instances, storage buckets, databases, etc.

In the example:

- **Tony Bowtie's Permissions**: Tony's manager, Lark, set a policy on the "Department B" folder (which could represent a department or a team) that grants Tony the "Project Owner" role. Because this permission was set at the folder level, and folders can contain multiple projects, Tony inherits this "Project Owner" role for both Project X and Project Y. This demonstrates how permissions set at a higher level in the hierarchy cascade downwards.
- **Laura's Permissions**: At the same time, Lark gave Laura the "Cloud Storage Admin" role, but only on Project X. This means Laura has permission to manage cloud storage buckets only within Project X, and this role does not affect Project Y. This is an example of more granular, project-level permission.

The key takeaway here is understanding how the GCP resource hierarchy functions. IAM policies set at a higher level (like the organization or folder level) will cascade and be inherited by resources below. However, if you set permissions at a specific project or resource level, it applies only to that particular entity.

This approach provides a lot of flexibility. It allows you to set broad permissions where needed, while still maintaining the ability to finely tune access at lower levels when necessary. It also underscores the importance of being careful when setting permissions, especially at higher hierarchy levels, as they will impact a wide range of resources.

## Google IAM Best Practices

Certainly! Here's a list of best practices for Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM):

1. **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Assign only the minimum permissions necessary for a user or service account to perform their tasks. This helps limit potential security risks.
2. **Use Predefined Roles:** Prefer predefined roles provided by the cloud platform over custom roles. These roles are well-defined and have least privilege principles built in.
3. **Granularity:** Assign roles at the smallest scope necessary. Avoid assigning broad roles like "Owner" or "Editor" unless absolutely needed. Use more specific roles whenever possible.
4. **Resource Hierarchy:** Organize your cloud resources in a way that mirrors your organizational structure. This makes it easier to manage and apply IAM policies consistently.
5. **Use Projects to Group Resources:** Group resources with the same trust boundaries into projects. This simplifies management and access control.
6. **Organizational-Level Policies:** Set IAM policies at the organization level when appropriate. This ensures consistent access control across all projects.
7. **Folder-Level Permissions:** When granting access across multiple projects, consider assigning permissions at the folder level. This provides a structured way to manage access.
8. **Service Account Isolation:** Create separate service accounts for different applications or components. This limits the scope of access and enhances security.
9. **Service Account Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate service account keys to minimize the risk of compromise. Ensure a smooth transition from old keys to new ones.
10. **Name Service Accounts and Keys Meaningfully:** Use descriptive names for service accounts and keys to understand their purpose and permissions at a glance.
11. **Audit Logs:** Regularly review cloud audit logs to monitor changes to IAM policies and identify unauthorized access or changes.
12. **Access Restrictions to Audit Logs:** Restrict access to audit logs to only those who need it. Ensure that unauthorized users cannot view these logs.
13. **Google Groups for Role Assignments:** Assign roles to Google Groups rather than individual users. It simplifies user management, especially when adding or removing members.
14. **Regular Review of Permissions:** Periodically review and update IAM policies to align with changing organizational needs and security requirements.
15. **Export Audit Logs for Long-Term Retention:** Export audit logs to cloud storage for long-term retention and compliance purposes.
16. **Avoid Storing Keys in Code or Public Locations:** Never store service account keys in source code or public directories, as this can lead to security vulnerabilities.
17. **Restrict Permissions for Service Account Key Access:** Limit access to service account keys to only authorized personnel.
18. **Regularly Audit Service Account Key Access:** Audit who is accessing service account keys to detect misuse or unauthorized access.
19. **Educate and Train Personnel:** Provide training and education to your team members to ensure they understand and follow IAM best practices.
20. **Follow Cloud Platform's Documentation:** Stay updated with the cloud platform's official documentation for best practices and security recommendations.

## Network Refresher

1. **Introduction to Networking:**
    - Computers were initially standalone and couldn't communicate.
    - Networking allowed computers to share data and resources.
    - IP addresses are used to identify computers on a network, similar to street addresses for homes.
2. **The OSI Model:**
    - The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers.
    - Layer 3 (Network Layer) and Layer 4 (Transport Layer) are discussed in detail.
    - Layer 7 (Application Layer) includes various networking protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and SSH.
3. **IPv4:**
    - IPv4 addresses are represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - There are classes (A, B, C) of IP addresses with different ranges.
    - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a more efficient way to allocate IP addresses.
4. **IPv6:**
    - IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal values.
    - Zero compression (::) is used to abbreviate long sequences of zeros.
    - IPv6 addresses are typically written as network addresses with a prefix (e.g., 2001:de3::/64).
5. **Transport Layer Protocols:**
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are discussed.
    - Packets contain source and destination IP addresses, protocol, port numbers, and data.
6. **Application Layer Protocols:**
    - Layer 7 includes various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and SSH.
    - These protocols enable networked applications to perform user activities.
7. **Subnetting:**
    - Subnetting is dividing a network into smaller subnetworks.
    - Subnet masks (CIDR notation) define network boundaries.
8. **Private IP Address Ranges:**
    - Certain IP address ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) are reserved for private networks.
    - Network Address Translation (NAT) is used for private networks to communicate over the public internet.
9. **IPv6 Abbreviations:**
    - IPv6 addresses can be abbreviated to remove redundant zeros and use double colons (::).
10. **OSI Layer Summary:**
    - Layer 3 (Network Layer) handles routing and IP addressing.
    - Layer 4 (Transport Layer) manages data transfer with protocols like TCP and UDP.
    - Layer 7 (Application Layer) encompasses various networking protocols for applications.
