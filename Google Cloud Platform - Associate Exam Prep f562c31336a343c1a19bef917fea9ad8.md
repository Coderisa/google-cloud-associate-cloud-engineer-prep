## 5 characteristics that define cloud computing

1. **On-demand self-service:** Cloud users can provision computing resources, such as compute, storage, and networking, on demand. This means that users can scale up or down their resources as needed, without having to worry about provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure.
2. **Broad network access:** Cloud resources are accessible over the internet, which means that users can access them from anywhere. This makes cloud computing ideal for businesses that have a global workforce or that need to be able to access their data from anywhere.
3. **Resource pooling:** Cloud providers pool their resources and share them among multiple users. This allows cloud providers to achieve economies of scale and offer their services at a lower cost than traditional on-premises IT.
4. **Rapid elasticity:** Cloud resources can be scaled up or down rapidly, in response to changes in demand. This allows businesses to save money by only provisioning the resources they need, when they need them.
5. **Measured service:** Cloud providers charge their users based on the amount of resources they consume. This allows businesses to track their costs and optimize their usage.

These are just some of the characteristics that define cloud computing. Cloud computing is a rapidly evolving field, and new characteristics are being developed all the time.

## Cloud Deployment Model

A cloud deployment model is a way of organizing and delivering cloud computing services. There are three main cloud deployment models:

- **Public cloud:** Public clouds are owned and operated by a cloud service provider (CSP). Users access public clouds over the internet. Public clouds are the most popular cloud deployment model.
- **Private cloud:** Private clouds are owned and operated by an organization. Users access private clouds over a private network. Private clouds are often used by organizations that need to comply with specific security or regulatory requirements.
- **Hybrid cloud:** Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds. Users can access resources from both public and private clouds. Hybrid clouds are often used by organizations that want to take advantage of the benefits of both public and private clouds.

Here is a table that summarizes the different cloud deployment models:

| Cloud Deployment Model | Ownership | Access | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public cloud | CSP | Internet | Scalability, cost-effectiveness, ease of use | Security, compliance, control |
| Private cloud | Organization | Private network | Security, compliance, control | Cost, complexity |
| Hybrid cloud | Organization, CSP | Both public and private networks | Best of both worlds | Complexity, cost |

The best cloud deployment model for an organization will depend on its specific needs and requirements.

Here are some of the factors that organizations should consider when choosing a cloud deployment model:

- **Security:** The security of the cloud deployment model is a critical factor. Organizations need to make sure that their data is secure in the cloud.
- **Compliance:** Organizations that need to comply with specific security or regulatory requirements may need to use a private cloud.
- **Cost:** The cost of the cloud deployment model is also a factor. Public clouds are typically more cost-effective than private clouds.
- **Scalability:** The scalability of the cloud deployment model is important for organizations that need to be able to scale their cloud resources up or down as needed.
- **Control:** The level of control that an organization has over the cloud deployment model is also a factor. Private clouds offer more control than public clouds.

## Cloud Service Model Consepts

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS is like ordering a frozen pizza. The pizza company provides all of the ingredients, but you have to do the cooking yourself. This means that you have to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure, such as compute, storage, and networking.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS is like ordering a pizza from a restaurant. The restaurant provides the dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings, but you don't have to do any cooking. This means that you don't have to worry about provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure. Instead, you can focus on developing and deploying your applications.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS is like ordering a pizza from a delivery service. The delivery service provides the pizza, and you don't have to do anything. This means that you don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or developing anything. You can simply use the service as-is.

Here is a table that summarizes the different cloud service models and their pizza analogies:

| Cloud Service Model | Pizza Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Frozen pizza |
| Platform as a Service (PaaS) | Restaurant-made pizza |
| Software as a Service (SaaS) | Delivery-service pizza |

## Google Cloud Fundamentals

### Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

- Google Cloud has a global infrastructure of data centers and regions.
- There are currently 24 regions and 73 zones in Google Cloud.
- Each region is a geographic area with multiple zones.
- Zones are isolated from each other, so if one zone goes down, the others will still be up.
- Google Cloud uses a variety of technologies to ensure the reliability and performance of its global infrastructure.
- These technologies include:
    - Load balancing
    - Redundant storage
    - High-speed networking
    - Disaster recovery

Here are some additional details about Google Cloud Global Infrastructure:

- The regions are spread across the globe, so you can choose the region that is best for your application.
- The zones are located within each region, and they are designed to be as close to each other as possible.
- This helps to ensure that your application will have low latency, even if it is accessed from anywhere in the world.
- Google Cloud Global Infrastructure is designed to be highly reliable.
- If one zone goes down, your application will continue to run in the other zones.
- This helps to ensure that your application is always available.

- **Compute Engine** is a service that provides virtual machines (VMs) that can be used to run applications. VMs are customizable and can be scaled up or down as needed.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine** (GKE) is a service that manages Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Cloud Run** is a serverless compute platform that allows you to run stateless containers that are invocable via HTTP requests. Cloud Run is a good choice for applications that do not require persistent storage or state management.
- **App Engine** is a fully managed platform that allows you to run web applications and mobile backends. App Engine is a good choice for applications that require high availability and scalability.

| Service | Description | Use Case | Category |
